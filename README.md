## The App

The app is organized as follows. All pages can be found in the components folder. Any repeated components exist in the toolbox to be used in the pages. For simplicitly, we are using one master stylesheet loaded into each page from the app root, rather than dealing with unique styling for each page. This decision will allow for rapid, penetrating redesigns which effect the entire app. Each component takes a property 'stylesheet' which is used to define the style of each element.
